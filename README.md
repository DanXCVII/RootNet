# Virtual MRI Generation Pipeline

## Overview

This repository houses the implementation of a pipeline designed to generate virtual Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of root systems. The primary objective of this project is to use these virtual MRIs to train a Neural Network for the task of segmenting real MRI root scans.
